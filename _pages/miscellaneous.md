I was born in [Hefei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei), a tranquil city situated in the Chao Lake basin, Anhui Province, China. Prior to college, I had 18-year carefree time at the [K-12 Institute Attached to the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://kdfz.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) (Yes, kindergarten, elementary, middle and high, all in the same school). My best high school subjects are chinese history and organic chemistry. Unfortunately, I majored in neither of them during my higher-education.

In 2014, I moved to Chengdu, the hometown of panda, where I did my undergraduate study at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I contributed my leisure time to several student organizations. In 2016, I had the honor of being elected as the president of Student Association Union of UESTC, which is equivalent to student government in U.S. institutes. During my presidency, I oversaw financial auditing, secured funding for the annual culture and art festival, developed long-term plans for student clubs, represented students by providing advice to the university council, and advocated for students' rights and interests. I received the Second Class of People's Scholarship thrice in 2015, 2016, and 2017, as well as the Student Leadership Scholarship in 2016 and the Honor Graduate Scholarship in 2018.

From high school to college, I actively engaged in Model United Nations (MUN) activities for 7 years. From 2015 to 2016, I held the position of deputy secretary-general of Anhui Provincial Model United Nations Conference for High School Students (AHMUNC). In this role, I managed the marketing, public relations, and information technology departments of the organizing committee. Together with my colleagues, we successfully executed this large-scale model united nations conference twice, hosting over 1200 attendees from all corners of China. Additionally, I served as a dais member at the Nanking International Model United Nations Conference for High School Students (NKMUNC) in 2015 and as the director of the IT department at the Berkeley Model United Nations China (BMUN CHINA) in 2016 and 2017.

Through the UESTC Study Abroad Program, I spent the first semester of my senior year at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). Then, a few months later, the breeze of the scripps beach brought me back to La Jolla as a master student. Two years in SoCal almost transformed me to a hippie until I moved to Austin TX as a fresh [longhorn](https://www.utexas.edu/content/longhorn-traditions) in 2020. Amid the COVID-19 global pandemic, the kick-off of my Ph.D. study was terrible at all levels. Dangerous virus, deserted lab, empty classroom and virtual meeting stress, all these nightmares made me like a caveman. 

As there are still several years before a new title crowns me, I am now trying to keep my head above the water:)
