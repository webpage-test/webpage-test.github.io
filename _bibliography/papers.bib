  title={Modeling individual preferences reveals that face beauty is not universally perceived across cultures},
  abstract = {Face attractiveness confers considerable advantages in social interactions, with preferences likely reflecting psychobiological mechanisms shaped by natural selection. Theories of universal beauty propose that attractive faces comprise features that are closer to the population average while optimizing sexual dimorphism (masculine vs. feminine distinction). However, emerging evidence questions this model as an accurate representation of attractive faces, including representing the diversity of beauty preferences across cultures and their individual members. In this study, we used a data-driven method to model, at the individual and cultural levels, the features of attractive female faces, in two matched groups of young male participants (40 East Asians and 40 Western Europeans). We first generated a broad range of same- and other-ethnicity female faces with naturally varying shapes and complexions that participants rated on attractiveness. Then, we reverse correlated the specific features that modulated the perception of face attractiveness in each individual participant. From these individual models, we reconstructed the representation space of face attractiveness. In contrast to theories of universal beauty, we show that attractive face features are distinct from the average (and from sexual dimorphism) in both cultures. We then disentangle attractive face features into those that are shared across cultures, those that are culture-specific, and those that are specific to the individual participant. Our demonstration reveals that face beauty is grounded in diverse features sensitive to culture and ethnicity. Our results have a direct theoretical and methodological impact for representing diversity in theories of social perception and application for the design of culturally and ethnicity sensitive digital agents.},

  title={Modelling face memory reveals task-generalizable representations},
  author={Zhan, Jiayu and Garrod, Oliver GB and van Rijsbergen, Nicola and Schyns, Philippe G},
  abstract={Current cognitive theories are cast in terms of information-processing mechanisms that use mental representations. For example, people use their mental representations to identify familiar faces under various conditions of pose, illumination and ageing, or to draw resemblance between family members. Yet, the actual information contents of these representations are rarely characterized, which hinders knowledge of the mechanisms that use them. Here, we modelled the three-dimensional representational contents of 4 faces that were familiar to 14 participants as work colleagues. The representational contents were created by reverse-correlating identity information generated on each trial with judgements of the face’s similarity to the individual participant’s memory of this face. In a second study, testing new participants, we demonstrated the validity of the modelled contents using everyday face tasks that generalize identity judgements to new viewpoints, age and sex. Our work highlights that such models of mental representations are critical to understanding generalization behaviour and its underlying information-processing mechanisms.},

  title={Dynamic construction of reduced representations in the brain for perceptual decision behavior},
  abstract = {Over the past decade, extensive studies of the brain regions that support face, object, and scene recognition suggest that these regions have a hierarchically organized architecture that spans the occipital and temporal lobes, where visual categorizations unfold over the first 250 ms of processing. This same architecture is flexibly involved in multiple tasks that require task-specific representations—e.g. categorizing the same object as “a car” or “a Porsche.” While we partly understand where and when these categorizations happen in the occipito-ventral pathway, the next challenge is to unravel how these categorizations happen. That is, how does high-dimensional input collapse in the occipito-ventral pathway to become low dimensional representations that guide behavior? To address this, we investigated what information the brain processes in a visual perception task and visualized the dynamic representation of this information in brain activity. To do so, we developed stimulus information representation (SIR), an information theoretic framework, to tease apart stimulus information that supports behavior from that which does not. We then tracked the dynamic representations of both in magneto-encephalographic (MEG) activity. Using SIR, we demonstrate that a rapid (∼170 ms) reduction of behaviorally irrelevant information occurs in the occipital cortex and that representations of the information that supports distinct behaviors are constructed in the right fusiform gyrus (rFG). Our results thus highlight how SIR can be used to investigate the component processes of the brain by considering interactions between three variables (stimulus information, brain activity, behavior), rather than just two, as is the current norm.},
